# HellFire : 2d Shooter Game

A React + Typescript Based Shooter Game, that was made out of boredom. In this modern world, you may find these kind of shooter games, but they did not have multiplyer functionality. So This game is fricking <strong>"contra"</strong> with multiplayer or what a person will say <strong>"co-op"</strong>. This game's frontend is opensource, and has a seperate backend server that is also open source.
